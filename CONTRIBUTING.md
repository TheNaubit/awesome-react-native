# Contributing to Awesome React Native

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This list is community-driven and we welcome all quality submissions.

## Guidelines

### What qualifies?

- The project must be related to React Native
- It should be actively maintained (commits within the last 12 months)
- It should have meaningful documentation (at minimum a README)
- Open source projects are preferred, but well-documented commercial tools are accepted
- No duplicates - search existing entries before submitting

### What does NOT qualify?

- Abandoned projects with no recent activity
- Projects with fewer than 50 GitHub stars (exceptions for genuinely unique tools)
- Low-quality tutorials or blog posts
- Self-promotion without substance
- Projects that are forks with no significant changes

### Formatting

Each entry should follow this format:

```markdown
- [Project Name](https://link) - A concise, objective description ending with a period.
```

Rules:
- Description starts with a capital letter
- Description ends with a period
- No trailing whitespace
- No promotional language ("best", "amazing", "must-have")
- Keep descriptions to one sentence (two max for complex projects)
- Use the canonical project name (match the repo or npm package name)

### Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Fork** this repository
2. **Add your entry** in the appropriate category, maintaining alphabetical order
3. **One entry per PR** - makes review faster
4. **Use the PR template** - fill in all required fields
5. **Ensure your entry** passes the linting checks

### Suggesting a new category

If you think a new category is needed, open an issue first to discuss it. Categories should:
- Contain at least 3 potential entries
- Not overlap significantly with existing categories
- Have a clear, specific scope

### Reporting broken links or outdated entries

Open an issue with the `outdated` label. Include:
- The entry name and link
- Why you think it should be updated or removed
- A suggested replacement (if applicable)

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful. This is a collaborative project. Rude or dismissive behavior will not be tolerated.

## Questions?

Open an issue with the `question` label.
